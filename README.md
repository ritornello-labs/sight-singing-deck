A code-generated, function-first course for learning to read music by ear: sing
melodies, take dictation on a staff, identify wrong notes, and build rhythm fluency.
Everything needed for notation and audio is bundled into the deck, so it works
offline on Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile, and AnkiDroid.

**Available on AnkiWeb:** [Sight Singing](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/948253022?cb=1784080108165)
and [Music Dictation](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/166250534?cb=1784080288775).
The public generator, curriculum, and verification harness live here; generated
`.apkg` artifacts stay out of Git.

The project started as a 10-card MVP that validates the full pipeline:

- Python generates structured melody card data.
- A slim, Bravura-only VexFlow build renders notation inside Anki cards. It and
  all card scripts are **inlined into the note-type templates** (the deck ships
  no external `.js` media), so cards render offline on Desktop, iOS, and
  AnkiDroid without depending on any platform's media server.
- Shared media assets provide playback and rendering helpers.
- `genanki` packages the result into `.apkg` files.

See [`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for the one harmless, AnkiDroid-side
"Failed to load" message and platform-support notes (share this with users when
publishing).

Current work also includes fixed-audio curriculum planning, rhythm curriculum notes, and a transcription minigame/debug harness.

## Key Files

## Python Setup

```sh
uv sync --extra deck --extra dev
```

Build the main deck (the original 10-card MVP):

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_deck.py
```

Build the full generated curriculum:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_curriculum_deck.py
# fast smoke build (first N melodies per track):
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_curriculum_deck.py --limit 5
```

Generated APKG files are written under `out/`.

## Generated Curriculum

`scripts/build_curriculum_deck.py` generates the full function-first curriculum
from constraint specs (no hand-authored melodies). The pipeline lives under
`src/sight_singing/`:

- `theory/scales.py` — diatonic-index realization (0 = tonic), keys/modes,
  movable-do solfège, fixed per-(key, clef) tonic-octave anchoring.
- `curriculum/stages.py` — stages as constraint specs. `MAJOR_STAGES`,
  `MINOR_STAGES` (natural + a harmonic-minor leading-tone stage), and
  `INTERVAL_STAGES` (isolated two-note interval drills).
- `generate/melody_gen.py` — enumerate → hard-rule filter → musicality quality
  score → contour-signature diverse sampling.
- `build/library.py` — realize stages into card-ready melody records.

The deck ships several tracks as subdecks, each split into per-stage subdecks in
curriculum order. Top-level tracks carry a **numeric prefix** (so Anki's
alphabetical deck sort matches the study order) and a **role word**, and each
umbrella deck carries an in-app **how-to-use description** (Anki shows it on the
deck overview). The tiers express that this is not a strict 1→7 march:

- **1 · Core: Major** (C) and **2 · Core: Minor** (A, the relative minor) — the
  melodic spine; work these top to bottom. Every melody yields a **Sing** card
  and a **Transcribe** (dictation) card.
- **3 · Drill: Rhythm** (Treble / Bass) and **4 · Drill: Intervals** — run
  alongside the Core spine from early on. Intervals are isolated two-note drills
  (IV2–IV8), notated as two **half notes** so each fills a complete bar.
- **5 · Skill: Error Detection** — error-detection (see below).
- **6 · Transfer: Other Keys** (G / F major) and **7 · Transfer: Bass Clef**
  (C major / A minor) — bounded movable-do transfer tracks (a curated stage
  spread in other keys and bass clef, capped per stage), for once C major is
  fluent. The renderer draws the right **key signature** and only marks
  accidentals that deviate from it; cadences are transposed per key/mode (a real
  i-iv-**V**-i in minor, with the raised leading tone).

Phrases longer than one bar (e.g. the 5–6 note stages) are split into real
barred **measures**, and any incomplete final bar is padded with **rests**, so
the notation always respects the time signature.

The rhythm track (**3 · Drill: Rhythm**) is rhythm-first cards (`generate/rhythm.py`,
  `make_rhythm_model`): one bar on a single repeated pitch so the interest is
  pure timing. Stages **R1–R9**: quarters/halves/wholes, rests, beamed eighth
  pairs, mixed fillings, offbeat eighth rests, dotted quarters, **ties/
  syncopation** (offbeat quarters written as tied eighths across the beat),
  **beat-level triplets**, and a full mixed-review stage. Each bar carries a
  separate notation view (`render_events`, with tie/tuplet flags) and audio view
  (ties merged to one sustained note, triplet eighths as `8t` = ⅓ beat).

The **Error Detection** track is a separate note type (`make_error_model`): you see the
written score and hear a performance with exactly one in-key wrong note, and tap
the note that sounds wrong. It is **generated on the fly per view** — each note
ships *every* single-note wrong-performance variant (`generate/errors.py`
`make_error_variants`, one content-hashed clip each), and the card picks one at
random each review, so the wrong note is never at a fixed, memorisable spot.
Because Anki does not reliably carry JS state from the front render to the back
render across platforms, grading and the reveal happen **on the front, on tap**
(the wrong note turns red, your tap is graded); the back is a best-effort
enhancement that re-shows the verdict/label when the front's choice survived
(Desktop/iOS) and degrades to a neutral note otherwise (AnkiDroid). The tap +
reveal live in `assets/_errordetect.js` (driving the renderer's per-note
`styles` option; a defensive dep-poll bootstrap keeps it robust on iOS/Android).

**Audio clues** (buttons on the card, plus a per-side autoplay config block in
the templates): Cadence, First note, Tonic, and a sustained **Drone** (an organ
tonic held under the singing, doubled at the octave below). Melody/note/cadence/
drone clips are content-hashed so Anki's importer always picks up changes.

**Phase checkpoints / custom study:** every note is tagged `phase::<phase>`,
`stage::<id>`, `track::<track>`, and `key::<key>_<mode>`, so mixed-review
checkpoints are just saved searches, e.g.
`deck:"Sight Singing::1 · Core: Major" tag:phase::steps` or `tag:stage::M5 OR tag:stage::M6`.

## Transcription Debug Harness

Install JavaScript debug dependencies through Socket Firewall:

```sh
sfw npm install
```

Run the debug server from the repository root:

```sh
npm run debug:server
```

Run the Playwright transcription check:

```sh
npm run test:transcription
```

## Audio Clues

Both card templates autoplay a configurable sequence of clues. The defaults
are `["tonic"]` on the Sing front (cadence and first-note stay available as
buttons) and `["tonic", "melody"]` on the Transcribe front. To change them,
edit the clearly-marked "Audio clue configuration" script block at the top of
the card templates (available keys: `cadence`, `first`, `tonic`, `melody`).

Audio clip filenames embed a content hash (see `AUDIO_RENDER_VERSION` in
[`src/sight_singing/audio_assets.py`](src/sight_singing/audio_assets.py)):
Anki's importer never overwrites an existing media file with the same name,
so any change to a melody or to render parameters must produce a new
filename. After re-importing an updated deck, run Tools → Check Media in
Anki to delete the orphaned older clips.

## Notes

- `node_modules/`, `test-results/`, `out/`, rendered audio, and local render caches are intentionally ignored.
- The project uses `uv`'s `exclude-newer = "7 days"` policy and an npm `.npmrc` minimum release-age policy for dependency safety.
